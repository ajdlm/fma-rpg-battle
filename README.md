# Fullmetal Alchemist: The RPG Fighting Game

A simple RPG-style fighting game that pits one character against three others.

Deployed game at https://ajdlm.github.io/fma-rpg-battle/.

## How to Play

* Start by clicking on a character. This will become your avatar for the rest of the game.

* Following this, click on one of the other characters to choose them as your opponent.

* Click on the ATTACK button until they is defeated. Each time that you click on it, you will receive feedback on how much damage you have done.

* Whenever you damage an enemy, provided that their HP doesn't fall below 0, they will counterattack you for a set amount of damage.

* The amount of damage done by a given character's counterattack will not change and will be different depending on the enemy chosen.

* When chosen as the player's avatar, however, the same character will do a different amount of damage.

* Additionally, unlike in the case of counterattack damage, this number will increment by its starting value after each attack. That is, if a character's base damage is 8, it will become 16 on their second attack, then 24 on their third, etc.

* If your character's HP falls below 0, you will lose the game. If your opponent's does, you will be allowed to choose another enemy to fight.

* When all three enemies are defeated, you will win the game.

## Tips

* An observant player will keep track of which enemies do how much damage and adjust their strategy on subsequent playthroughs.

* Enemies with higher HP values will tend to do more damage on attacks and counterattacks.
